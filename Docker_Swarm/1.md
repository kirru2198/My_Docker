# Docker Swarm Overview

## Introduction to Docker Swarm
- **Docker Swarm** is a container orchestration tool that is native to Docker.
- It allows you to manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system.
- Swarm provides features such as high availability, scaling, and load balancing for containerized applications.

## Key Concepts
1. **Nodes**: 
   - A Docker Swarm consists of multiple nodes, which can be either managers or workers.
   - **Manager Node**: Responsible for managing the swarm and orchestrating tasks.
   - **Worker Node**: Executes tasks assigned by the manager.

2. **Cluster**: 
   - A collection of Docker nodes that work together to run containerized applications.

3. **Services**: 
   - A service is a definition of how to run a containerized application, including the number of replicas.

## Setting Up Docker Swarm
1. **Initialize Swarm**:
   - On the manager node, run the command:
     ```bash
     docker swarm init --advertise-addr <manager-ip>
     ```
   - This command initializes the swarm and designates the current node as the manager.

2. **Join Worker Nodes**:
   - After initializing the swarm, a join command is provided. Run this command on worker nodes to add them to the swarm:
     ```bash
     docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-ip>:2377
     ```

3. **Verify Nodes**:
   - Use the command `docker node ls` on the manager node to see the status of all nodes in the swarm.

## Deploying Applications
1. **Create a Service**:
   - To deploy an application, use the `docker service create` command. For example, to create an Nginx service with three replicas:
     ```bash
     docker service create --name nginx --replicas 3 -p 80:80 nginx
     ```

2. **Check Service Status**:
   - Use `docker service ls` to see the status of the services running in the swarm.

3. **Scaling Services**:
   - You can scale services up or down using:
     ```bash
     docker service scale <service-name>=<number-of-replicas>
     ```

## Networking in Docker Swarm
- Docker Swarm uses an **overlay network** to facilitate communication between containers running on different nodes.
- The overlay network creates a virtual network that allows containers to communicate securely across the swarm.

## Multi-Stage Builds
1. **Purpose**:
   - Multi-stage builds are used to reduce the size of Docker images by allowing you to copy only the necessary artifacts from one stage to another.

2. **Example**:
   - Create a Dockerfile with multiple stages to build a Python application:
     ```dockerfile
     # Stage 1: Build
     FROM python:3.9 AS builder
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY requirements.txt .
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

     # Stage 2: Run
     FROM python:3.9-slim
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY --from=builder /app .
     CMD ["python", "app.py"]
     ```

3. **Benefits**:
   - The final image size is reduced because unnecessary files from the build stage are not included in the final image.

## Conclusion
- Docker Swarm is a powerful tool for orchestrating containerized applications, providing features like scaling, load balancing, and high availability.
- Understanding how to set up and manage a Docker Swarm cluster is essential for deploying applications in a production environment.
- Multi-stage builds are a valuable technique for optimizing Docker images.
