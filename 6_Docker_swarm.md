# Docker Swarm (Container Orchestration Tool)

## What is Docker Swarm?

**Docker Swarm** is a native container orchestration tool provided by Docker. It allows you to manage a cluster of Docker nodes (machines) and deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications across multiple machines. Swarm helps automate the process of managing containers, making it easier to scale your application, balance the load, and ensure high availability.

---

## How Does Docker Swarm Work?

In a **Swarm cluster**, there are multiple nodes (machines), where one node acts as the **master (manager)** and others as **workers**. Docker Swarm ensures containers are distributed across nodes and takes care of load balancing, scaling, and managing your applications.

- **Master (Manager) Node**: Coordinates the Swarm cluster, makes decisions about where containers should run, and schedules tasks.
- **Worker Nodes**: Execute tasks assigned by the manager node (e.g., running containers).

---

## Key Features of Docker Swarm:

- **High Availability**: Docker Swarm ensures your applications are highly available by automatically handling failover if a node goes down.
- **Scaling**: You can scale services in or out, adding or removing replicas of a container depending on your application needs.
- **Load Balancing**: Docker Swarm automatically load balances incoming traffic to the containers.
- **Cluster Management**: It provides tools to manage containers across multiple nodes, distributing the load and resources efficiently.

---

## Setting Up Docker Swarm Cluster

### 1. **Stop Docker Compose**:
Before setting up Docker Swarm, stop any running containers with Docker Compose on both the master and worker machines:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 2. **Check for Running Containers**:
Ensure no containers are running on either machine by running:

```bash
docker ps
```

This will confirm that all containers are stopped.

### 3. **Initialize Docker Swarm on Master Node**:
On the master (manager) machine, run the following command to initialize Docker Swarm:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <Master-IP>
```

Replace `<Master-IP>` with the actual IP address of the master node (e.g., `10.0.5.8`). This command initializes Docker Swarm and generates a join command that you will need to run on the worker node.

### 4. **Add Worker Node to the Swarm**:
On the worker (slave) machine, run the join command that was generated by the master node. This will add the worker node to the Swarm cluster.

### 5. **Verify Nodes in the Swarm**:
Back on the master node, verify the Swarm cluster nodes:

```bash
docker node ls
```

This will list all nodes in the Swarm, including the master (manager) and the worker.

### 6. **Open Ports if Necessary**:
Ensure that port **2377** is open in your security groups or VPC settings to allow communication between the nodes.

## Communication Between EC2 Instances in Docker Swarm

You have two types of communication between EC2 instances in Docker Swarm:

1. **Public Communication**:
   - Traffic flows through the **Internet Gateway (IGW)**, where instances use public IP addresses to communicate with each other.
   - This is suitable when your instances need to communicate over the internet.

2. **Private Communication**:
   - When using **private IP addresses**, EC2 instances can communicate directly within the same **VPC/subnet**.
   - This method avoids internet traffic and firewall issues, providing a more secure communication method.

---

## Creating a Docker Swarm Cluster

### 1. **Swarm Initialization**:
Run `docker swarm init` on the master node to initialize it as the manager.

### 2. **Adding Worker Nodes**:
On the worker nodes, run the `docker swarm join` command that was generated on the master node. This adds them as worker nodes.

### 3. **Creating a Docker Service**:
On the master node, create a Docker service. For example, to create a 3-replica NGINX service:

```bash
docker service create --name nginx --replicas 3 -p 80:80 nginx
```

- This will create 3 replicas (containers) of the NGINX service, and Docker Swarm will distribute them across the available nodes.
- For instance:
  - Master might get 1 container.
  - Slave might get 2 containers.
- Docker Swarm decides where to place each container based on resource availability.

### 4. **How Docker Swarm Decides Where to Run Containers**:
Docker Swarm uses resource availability (e.g., CPU, RAM) to determine where to run the containers. For example, if one node has more free resources (RAM/CPU), Docker will prefer to run the containers on that node.

---

## Controlling Container Placement in Docker Swarm

By default, Docker Swarm automatically decides where containers should run based on the available resources. However, you can restrict container placement with specific rules, although this is more advanced and will be covered in detail in Kubernetes.

---

## Docker Swarm Overlay Network

When containers on different nodes need to communicate, Docker Swarm creates an **overlay network**. This network allows containers on different nodes to communicate as if they were on the same machine, even across different subnets or regions.

- **Overlay Network**: It’s a private virtual network created on top of the existing network infrastructure (such as VPC). This enables seamless communication between containers on different machines in the Swarm cluster.

---

## Example of Cluster Setup

### 1. **Initialize Swarm**:
On the master node, run:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <Master-IP>
```

### 2. **Add Worker Nodes**:
On the worker nodes, run the `docker swarm join` command received from the master node to add them as workers.

### 3. **Create an Overlay Network**:
When Docker Swarm is initialized, an overlay network is automatically created to connect the nodes in the cluster. This allows the containers to communicate without directly using the EC2 instance’s private IP addresses.

---

## Summary of Docker Swarm Features

- **Automatic Container Placement**: Docker Swarm decides where containers should run based on available resources and node health.
- **Overlay Network**: Enables communication between containers across nodes and subnets.
- **Replica Scaling**: You can define how many replicas of a service you want, and Docker Swarm distributes them across nodes.
- **High Availability**: Swarm ensures that your applications are always available, even in case of node failures.
- **Load Balancing**: Swarm automatically balances traffic between containers running on different nodes.

---

## Types of Communication in Docker Swarm

1. **Node-to-Node Communication (EC2 Instances)**:
   - EC2 instances communicate through the VPC network, either using private IP addresses (within the same VPC/subnet) or public IP addresses (for internet access).

2. **Container-to-Container Communication**:
   - Containers on different nodes do not use the VPC network directly. Instead, they use the **overlay network** created by Docker Swarm, which allows them to communicate seamlessly across different nodes or subnets.

---

## Docker’s Role in Network Management

- **Overlay Network Management**: Docker automatically manages the overlay network when Docker Swarm is initialized. Without Swarm, Docker uses the default bridge network. However, Swarm automatically creates a dedicated overlay network for container communication.
- **Custom Overlay Networks**: You can create custom overlay networks for specific services or use cases.

## Multi-Stage Build in Docker

### What is Multi-Stage Build?

A **multi-stage build** in Docker allows you to define multiple `FROM` instructions in a Dockerfile. This helps optimize (= make the image better and more useful) images by separating the build environment from the runtime environment, making the final image smaller and more efficient.

### Example:

- **Without Multi-Stage Build**: The resulting Docker image might be large, containing build dependencies and unnecessary files.
- **With Multi-Stage Build**: The final image contains only the runtime environment and necessary files, reducing the image size.

## Running a Database in Docker Swarm

You can also run a database container in Docker Swarm just like any other container. The process involves creating a service for the database, scaling replicas, and ensuring that the database is available and resilient within the Swarm cluster.

## Next Steps

After mastering Docker and Docker Swarm, the next steps would be to explore:
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code (IaC).
- **Ansible** for automation and configuration management.
- **Jenkins Pipelines** for automating deployments of Dockerized applications.

These tools will further enhance your ability to manage and scale containerized applications effectively.
