### Case-study

## 🚀 Problem Statement

You're working as a **DevOps Engineer** for a software company that needs to **Dockerize a custom Apache-based application** on the production server.

### Assumptions:

- The software to be installed is **Apache**
- Base image: **Ubuntu**

---

## 🛠️ Company Requirements

1. Push a container image to **Docker Hub** with the above config.
2. Developers will **not interact with Docker**. You will receive only the application code.
3. Write a **Dockerfile** that can integrate the application code into the custom Docker image.

---

## 📦 Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use Ubuntu as the base image
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Set the maintainer
LABEL maintainer="your-email@example.com"

# Disable interactive prompts during package installs
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Update system and install Apache2
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y apache2 && \
    apt-get clean

# Avoid server name warnings
RUN echo "ServerName localhost" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Copy application code to Apache's web directory
# Replace './your-app' with the actual code directory
COPY ./your-app /var/www/html/

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Apache in the foreground
CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

---

## 🔨 Step 2: Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and application code, then run:

```bash
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name .
```

> Replace `your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name` with your actual Docker Hub username and image name.

---

## ☁️ Step 3: Push the Image to Docker Hub

### 1. Login to Docker Hub

```bash
docker login
```

### 2. Tag the Image (if needed)

```bash
docker tag your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name:latest
```

### 3. Push the Image

```bash
docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name:latest
```

---

## 🔁 Step 4: Automate Developer Code Integration

Update the Dockerfile to reflect the correct application code path:

```Dockerfile
COPY ./developer-code /var/www/html/
```

> Developers only need to place their code in a known directory. You can automate this during the CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

- This setup is ideal for **static websites** or **basic PHP apps** using Apache.
- If the developers' application uses additional dependencies (e.g., PHP, Python), you can modify the `Dockerfile` accordingly.

Example (for PHP):

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get install -y php libapache2-mod-php
```
