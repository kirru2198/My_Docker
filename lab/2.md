### Assignment-2
## ðŸ§ª Tasks To Be Performed

1. Save the image created in Assignment 1 as a Docker image  
2. Launch container from this new image and map the port to **81**  
3. Go inside the container and start the **Apache2** service  
4. Check if you are able to access it on the browser  

---

### âœ… Task 1: Save the Image Created in Assignment 1 as a Docker Image

If you've installed Apache2 in the container, you can now create a new image from that modified container.

**Exit the container (if you're still inside):**

```bash
exit
```

**Commit the running container to create a new image:**

```bash
sudo docker commit ubuntu-apache my-ubuntu-apache
```

- `ubuntu-apache`: The name of the existing running container.  
- `my-ubuntu-apache`: The name for the new Docker image.

---

### âœ… Task 2: Launch a Container from This New Image and Map the Port to 81

```bash
sudo docker run -itd -p 81:80 my-ubuntu-apache
```
OR 
```bash
sudo docker run -itd -p 81:80 my-ubuntu-apache
```
you can check the containers by using the following command:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

- `-d`: Run in detached mode  
- `-p 81:80`: Map port 81 on the host to port 80 in the container  
- `--name ubuntu-apache-81`: Give the new container a unique name  
- `my-ubuntu-apache`: The Docker image name you just created

### âœ… Task 3: Go Inside the Container and Start Apache2

```bash
sudo docker exec -it <Container_id> bash
```

Inside the container, run:

```bash
service apache2 start
```

---

### âœ… Task 4: Check if You Can Access It on the Browser

Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:81
```

You should see the Apache2 default welcome page, now served from your newly created Docker image.

we shouldn't give same port to 2 containers, we should give different ports for different containers
