Here’s a summary of the Docker storage concept, container data, volumes, and backup practices:

# Docker Storage Concepts

## 1. Introduction to Docker Storage

We started by checking the state of our machine. After confirming nothing was running, we cleaned up all containers, images, and networks to reset everything to a fresh state.

### **Cleaning Up Everything:**
After running the cleanup commands, all volumes, images, and containers were deleted, leaving the machine in a clean state.

---

## 2. Exploring Docker Storage

Next, we created a container to explore how Docker handles storage:

### **Creating a Container:**
We created a container using the command:
```bash
docker run -d --name container100 alpine /bin/sh
```
This command starts a container named `container100` using the `alpine` image, and it runs in the background.

To confirm the container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

### **Accessing the Container:**
We attached to the container with the command:
```bash
docker attach container100
```
Once inside, we explored the file system inside the container. If we checked the host machine’s file system, it looked different from the container’s.

### **Creating Data Inside the Container:**
- We created a directory inside the container:
  ```bash
  mkdir /data
  ```
- Then, we created a file inside the `/data` directory:
  ```bash
  echo "This is my code" > /data/code.py
  ```
- Viewing the contents of the file:
  ```bash
  cat /data/code.py
  ```
  Output: `"This is my code"`

### **Key Takeaway:**
- The file `/data/code.py` was created inside the container. The data is stored within the container's file system.
- The data persists as long as the container remains intact.

### **Exiting the Container:**
To exit the container without stopping it, we used:
```bash
Ctrl + P, Ctrl + Q
```
This returns us to the host machine’s prompt, while the container keeps running.

---

## 3. Stopping and Restarting the Container

We tested stopping and restarting the container:

- **Stopping the Container**:
  ```bash
  docker stop container100
  ```
  
- **Starting the Container Again**:
  ```bash
  docker start container100
  ```

When we re-entered the container (`docker attach container100`), we found that the file `/data/code.py` was still there. This shows that the data persists even after stopping and starting the container.

---

## 4. Deleting Containers and Data

### **Deleting a Container:**
When a container is deleted, its data is also deleted:
```bash
docker rm container100
```
- If we recreate the container using the same image, it doesn’t have the data because it was stored within the deleted container.

### **Container Data and Read-Only Layers:**
- Containers have a small **write layer** that stores any changes made to the container (like created files).
- This write layer is deleted when the container is removed, explaining why data is lost when the container is deleted.

---

## 5. Introducing Docker Volumes

### **Why Volumes Are Important:**
To preserve data beyond the life of a container, we use **volumes**. Volumes are persistent storage that exist independently of containers. They allow data to survive even after a container is deleted.

- **Think of Volumes as External Storage**: Similar to how a hard drive or a pen drive works, volumes keep your data safe even if the container is deleted.

---

## 6. Creating and Using Volumes

### **Creating a Volume:**
We can create a volume using the following command:
```bash
docker volume create my_volume
```

### **Mounting a Volume to a Container:**
To use the volume with a container, we can mount it:
```bash
docker run -d --name my_container -v my_volume:/path/in/container nginx
```
This command mounts the `my_volume` to the specified path inside the container (`/path/in/container`).

### **Inspecting Volumes:**
To inspect the volume and view its details:
```bash
docker inspect my_volume
```

---

## 7. Conclusion on Docker Volumes

- **Persistent Data Storage**: Volumes solve the problem of data loss when containers are removed. You can store logs, databases, or any data that should persist even after a container is deleted.
- **Data Is Independent of Container Lifecycle**: Volumes are not deleted when you delete a container, meaning you can reuse the volume across different containers.

---

## 8. Docker Run with `-i` and `-t` Options

- **Interactive Containers**: When you run a container with the `-i` and `-t` options, you get an interactive terminal. This allows you to interact with the container as if it were a regular terminal.
  
- **Non-Interactive Containers**: Without `-i` and `-t`, the container runs but without interaction, so you won’t see feedback or output in the terminal.

---

## 9. Stopping and Deleting Containers

- **Stopping a Container**: Stopping a container will stop its execution, but the data stored in volumes will remain intact.
  
- **Deleting a Container**: Deleting a container won’t delete data stored in volumes. Volumes are independent of the container lifecycle, so the data in volumes will persist.

---

## 10. Example with Volumes

We demonstrated the use of volumes by creating two volumes (`my_wall` and `nginx_log`) and mounting them to containers. Even after deleting the containers, the data in the volumes remained intact.

This is similar to **EBS volumes in EC2**:
- EBS volumes provide persistent storage in the cloud.
- If you terminate an EC2 instance, you can choose to retain the EBS volume, allowing you to attach it to another EC2 instance later.

---

## 11. Data and Backup Considerations

### **Why Backups Are Important:**
- If your local machine crashes, you may lose data unless you use third-party storage solutions (like cloud storage).
- **Cloud Storage**: Storing data remotely ensures that it is safe even if your local machine fails.

### **Backup Policy**:
- A proper backup policy ensures that even if your primary storage system fails, you can recover your data from a backup.

---

## Summary

- **Containers** are temporary and can be deleted without losing data stored in volumes.
- **Volumes** provide persistent storage that exists independently of containers, making them ideal for storing logs, databases, and other important data.
- **EBS Volumes in EC2** work similarly to Docker volumes, ensuring data persistence even if the EC2 instance is terminated.
- Proper **backup practices** and **remote storage solutions** are essential for ensuring data safety.

By understanding Docker volumes and storage, you can manage persistent data in your containers and ensure data integrity even in the event of container removal or crashes.
