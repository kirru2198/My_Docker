Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Create a Docker swarm cluster with 3 nodes
 2. Deploy an Apache container with 4 replicas

---
Here‚Äôs a **detailed, step-by-step solution** for creating a **Docker Swarm cluster with 3 nodes** and deploying an **Apache container with 4 replicas**.

This guide includes both the **conceptual setup (for virtual or cloud machines)** and the **actual Docker commands**.

---

## üßæ **Assignment Tasks Overview**

1. ‚úÖ Create a **Docker Swarm cluster** with **1 manager** and **2 worker nodes** (total 3 nodes).
2. ‚úÖ Deploy an **Apache container service** with **4 replicas** running across the cluster.

---

## üîß **Prerequisites**

* You need **3 Linux machines** or VMs (can be local or cloud) with:

  * Docker installed
  * Network connectivity between them

Example hostnames/IPs:

* `manager`: 192.168.1.10
* `worker1`: 192.168.1.11
* `worker2`: 192.168.1.12

> If you're testing locally, you can simulate this with VMs or Docker-in-Docker using tools like **Multipass**, **VirtualBox**, or **Play with Docker**.

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 1: Initialize Docker Swarm on the Manager Node**

On the **manager node**, run:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.10
```

* This command initializes the Swarm and shows a **`docker swarm join`** command with a token.
* Copy the entire `docker swarm join` command output.

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 2: Join the Worker Nodes to the Swarm**

On **each worker node** (`worker1` and `worker2`), paste and run the `docker swarm join` command you got from the manager. It will look like this:

```bash
docker swarm join --token <token> 192.168.1.10:2377
```

To confirm they joined, run this on the **manager**:

```bash
docker node ls
```

You should see 3 nodes: 1 leader and 2 workers.

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 3: Deploy Apache Service with 4 Replicas**

On the **manager node**, deploy the Apache service:

```bash
docker service create \
  --name apache-service \
  --replicas 4 \
  --publish published=8080,target=80 \
  httpd:latest
```

**Explanation:**

* `--replicas 4`: Run 4 instances of Apache
* `--publish 8080:80`: Maps port 80 inside container to port 8080 on the manager node
* `httpd:latest`: The Apache Docker image

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 4: Verify the Deployment**

Check the service status:

```bash
docker service ls
```

Check the placement of the containers (replicas):

```bash
docker service ps apache-service
```

You‚Äôll see 4 running replicas spread across the 3 nodes.

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 5: Test in Browser or Curl**

From your browser or terminal, go to:

```bash
http://<manager_ip>:8080
```

You should see the default Apache web page.

Use curl for testing:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

You‚Äôll get the Apache welcome message.

---

## üßº Optional: Remove the Service

```bash
docker service rm apache-service
```

---

## üìù Summary of Commands (in order):

### On Manager Node:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.10
```

### On Worker Nodes:

```bash
docker swarm join --token <token> 192.168.1.10:2377
```

### On Manager Node to Deploy Apache:

```bash
docker service create \
  --name apache-service \
  --replicas 4 \
  --publish published=8080,target=80 \
  httpd:latest
```

### Verify:

```bash
docker node ls
docker service ls
docker service ps apache-service
```
