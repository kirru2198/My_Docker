 Problem Statement:
 
 You have been hired as a DevOps Engineer in GrapeVine Pvt. Ltd. You have been asked to improve the way the company is managing their Docker containers.
 
 Following tasks have been assigned:
 1. Deploy a sample HTML website in any Apache container and demonstrate how we can dynamically change content in the container by making changes on the host machine ( bind mounts)
 2. Deploy Apache and NGINX containers using Docker Compose. Apache should be exposed on Port 91 and NGINX on port 92
 3. Initialize a Docker swarm cluster and deploy two Ubuntu containers in an overlay network. Demonstrate they can communicate with each other by pinging them

---

Here's a **complete and detailed solution** to the problem statement you provided. Each task will be explained with steps, commands, and clear reasoning. This solution will help GrapeVine Pvt. Ltd. better manage Docker containers through **bind mounts**, **Docker Compose**, and **Docker Swarm**.

---

## 🧾 **Problem Breakdown and Solutions**

---

## ✅ **Task 1: Deploy a sample HTML website in an Apache container using bind mounts**

### 🧠 Goal:

* Run an Apache container that serves a website.
* Use a **bind mount** so changing files on the **host** immediately updates the website inside the container.

---

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Step 1: Create a directory for website files

```bash
mkdir ~/grapevine-site
cd ~/grapevine-site
```

#### Step 2: Create a sample HTML page

```bash
echo "<h1>Welcome to GrapeVine!</h1>" > index.html
```

#### Step 3: Run an Apache container with a bind mount

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name apache-bind \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v ~/grapevine-site:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ \
  httpd:latest
```

* `-v ~/grapevine-site:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/` → Host folder is bind-mounted to the Apache web root.

#### Step 4: Test it

Go to your browser and open:
👉 `http://localhost:8080`
You should see: **"Welcome to GrapeVine!"**

#### Step 5: Update the content dynamically

```bash
echo "<h1>Site Updated! Hello from DevOps Team</h1>" > ~/grapevine-site/index.html
```

Refresh the browser — the new message will appear without restarting the container.

---

## ✅ **Task 2: Deploy Apache and NGINX using Docker Compose**

### 🧠 Goal:

* Run **Apache** on port **91** and **NGINX** on port **92** using Docker Compose.

---

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Step 1: Create project directory

```bash
mkdir ~/grapevine-compose
cd ~/grapevine-compose
```

#### Step 2: Create `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  apache:
    image: httpd:latest
    ports:
      - "91:80"
    container_name: apache-container

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "92:80"
    container_name: nginx-container
```

Save it as `docker-compose.yml` in `~/grapevine-compose`.

#### Step 3: Launch containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Step 4: Test it

Open these URLs in your browser:

* Apache → [http://localhost:91](http://localhost:91)
* NGINX → [http://localhost:92](http://localhost:92)

You should see the default pages of each web server.

---

## ✅ **Task 3: Initialize Docker Swarm and deploy Ubuntu containers in overlay network**

### 🧠 Goal:

* Create a **Docker Swarm cluster**.
* Deploy **2 Ubuntu containers** in a custom **overlay network**.
* Demonstrate they can **ping** each other.

---

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Step 1: Initialize Docker Swarm (on manager node)

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
```

> Replace `<MANAGER-IP>` with the actual IP of your machine.

#### Step 2: Create an overlay network

```bash
docker network create \
  --driver overlay \
  --attachable \
  grapevine-overlay
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Ubuntu service #1

```bash
docker service create \
  --name ubuntu1 \
  --network grapevine-overlay \
  --replicas 1 \
  ubuntu \
  sleep 10000
```

#### Step 4: Deploy Ubuntu service #2

```bash
docker service create \
  --name ubuntu2 \
  --network grapevine-overlay \
  --replicas 1 \
  ubuntu \
  sleep 10000
```

#### Step 5: Exec into one container and ping the other

1. Find container ID:

```bash
docker ps
```

2. Enter one container:

```bash
docker exec -it <ubuntu1-container-id> bash
```

3. Inside the container, run:

```bash
ping ubuntu2
```

You should see successful ping replies — verifying that the **overlay network allows cross-container communication**.

## ✅ Summary of Commands

### 🔹 Task 1 – Apache + Bind Mount

```bash
mkdir ~/grapevine-site
echo "<h1>Hello from GrapeVine!</h1>" > ~/grapevine-site/index.html
docker run -d --name apache-bind -p 8080:80 -v ~/grapevine-site:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:latest
```

---

### 🔹 Task 2 – Apache + NGINX via Compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  apache:
    image: httpd
    ports:
      - "91:80"
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "92:80"
```

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### 🔹 Task 3 – Swarm + Overlay Network

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
