 Here's a detailed step-by-step solution for your assignment, using **bind mounts** with an Apache2 container to allow **dynamic updating of HTML files**:

---

## 🧾 **Assignment Tasks & Solution**

### ✅ **Task 1: Use the Apache2 container created in the previous module**

We assume you already have:

* An **Apache2 Docker image** (`httpd:latest` or a custom image)
* A running or previously used Apache container

If the container from the previous module was stopped or deleted, no worries—we’ll start a new one using the same image.

---

### ✅ **Task 2: Create a bind mount on `/var/www/html` to replace HTML files dynamically**

#### 🧠 What is a Bind Mount?

A **bind mount** allows you to link a directory from your host machine (your computer) to a folder **inside the container**.
This lets you **edit files on your host**, and the changes are instantly visible to the web server running in the container—great for web development.

---

### 📁 **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### 🔹 Step 1: Create a directory on your host to store HTML files

```bash
mkdir ~/apache-html
```

> This is where you’ll put your `index.html` and other files.

#### 🔹 Step 2: Add a sample HTML file (optional for testing)

```bash
echo '<h1>Hello from Bind Mount!</h1>' > ~/apache-html/index.html
```

#### 🔹 Step 3: Run the Apache2 container with a bind mount

For the **official Apache image (`httpd`)**, the default web root is:

```
/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
```

So you run:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name apache-container \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v ~/apache-html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs \
  httpd:latest
```

> ✅ This tells Docker:
> "Run the Apache container, and connect my local folder `~/apache-html` to the folder in the container where Apache serves web pages."

---

### 💡 Alternative (Custom Image Using `/var/www/html`)

If you're using a **custom Apache image** that serves files from `/var/www/html`, use this instead:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name apache-container \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v ~/apache-html:/var/www/html \
  your-custom-apache-image
```

---

### ✅ Summary of All Commands:

```bash
# 1. Create a folder for your website files
mkdir ~/apache-html

# 2. Add a simple HTML file
echo "<h1>Hello from Bind Mount!</h1>" > ~/apache-html/index.html

# 3. Run the Apache container with bind mount (official image)
docker run -d \
  --name apache-container \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v ~/apache-html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs \
  httpd:latest
```

---

### 🧪 Test It:

Open a browser and go to:
**[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**

You should see:
**"Hello from Bind Mount!"**

Any changes you make to `index.html` in your local folder will update instantly on the site.
