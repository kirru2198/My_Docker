Sure! Here's a **detailed solution** to your assignment step-by-step. It includes launching the Apache2 container and attaching a Docker volume to `/var/www/html`, which is the default web directory for Apache.

## 🧾 **Assignment Tasks & Detailed Commands**

### ✅ **1. Launch the Apache2 container**

We assume that the **Apache2 Docker image** was either created or pulled in a previous step (e.g., using a custom Dockerfile or the official Apache image).

If you're using the **official Apache image** from Docker Hub (e.g., `httpd`), you can use:

```bash
docker pull httpd:latest
```

Then, to launch the Apache2 container:

```bash
docker run -d --name apache-container httpd:latest
```

**Explanation:**

* `-d`: Run container in detached mode (in background)
* `--name apache-container`: Gives the container a name
* `httpd:latest`: The Apache2 image (latest version from Docker Hub)

> ✅ At this point, the Apache2 container is running.

---

### ✅ **2. Create a Docker volume and mount it to `/var/www/html`**

First, **create a Docker volume**:

```bash
docker volume create apache-html
```

**Explanation:**

* This creates a managed Docker volume named `apache-html` that can be mounted into containers.

Now, stop and remove the previous container so we can re-run it with the volume attached:

```bash
docker stop apache-container
docker rm apache-container
```

Then, **launch the Apache container again**, this time mounting the volume to `/var/www/html`:

```bash
docker run -d --name apache-container -v apache-html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs httpd:latest
```

> 📌 Note: For the official `httpd` image, the correct document root is `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs`, **not** `/var/www/html`.
> If you're using a **custom Apache image** where the web root is `/var/www/html`, use this instead:

```bash
docker run -d --name apache-container -v apache-html:/var/www/html your-custom-apache-image
```

---

## ✅ Summary of Commands (In Order):

```bash
# Step 1: Pull Apache image (if not already present)
docker pull httpd:latest

# Step 2: Create Docker volume
docker volume create apache-html

# Step 3: Run the container with volume mounted
docker run -d --name apache-container -v apache-html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs httpd:latest
```

If you're using `/var/www/html` in a custom image:

```bash
docker run -d --name apache-container -v apache-html:/var/www/html your-custom-apache-image
```
