In this video, I want to address a common question I receive every week: how to connect a reverse proxy in Docker to other containers and manage Docker networks. I’ll explain the different Docker network types, such as bridges, MAC VLANs, and hosts, and provide examples of when and how to use them.

First, if you want to securely authenticate to your server or access your environments with two-factor authentication, check out our sponsor, Teleport. With Teleport, you can protect your server infrastructure, log user actions, and record sessions. You can install the free community edition at no cost, or if you need more features, they offer an enterprise version with 24/7 support and Active Directory integration.

Now, let’s talk about Docker networks. You might know that Docker automatically creates a default network where all deployed containers are attached. For simple setups, like a single-tier application (e.g., a web server or management tool), this default network is usually sufficient. 

However, if you plan to set up a more complex or multi-tier application, it’s important to configure your Docker networks. This allows you to specify how containers connect to each other and to the outside network. For example, you may need some containers to access a database or to be isolated from other containers on the host. In these cases, proper network configuration is essential.
