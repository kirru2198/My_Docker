A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component in your computer that connects it to the internet. When you plug a LAN cable into your computer, the male RJ45 connector connects to the female RJ45 port on the NIC. 

NICs can be wired or wireless. Wired NICs use LAN cables to share data, while wireless NICs connect devices to a Wi-Fi network. For example, your mobile phone connects to Wi-Fi using a wireless NIC. 

You can watch this video on YouTube because your device has a NIC.
