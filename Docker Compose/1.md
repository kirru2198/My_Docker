### Docker Compose

### ✅ **What is Docker Compose?**

Docker Compose is a tool used to define and run **multi-container Docker applications**. You describe your application's services, networks, and volumes in a **`docker-compose.yml`** file.

---

### 📄 **Why Use Docker Compose?**

Without Docker Compose, you’d need to:

1. Write individual Dockerfiles.
2. Manually build and run each container.
3. Set up networking between them.
4. Manage environment variables and volumes manually.

With Docker Compose, you can:

* Use a **YAML file** to define all services.
* Spin up the entire application stack using **`docker-compose up`**.

---

### 🔁 **Workflow with Docker Compose**

1. **Understand your application's architecture** (e.g., login service, menu service, payment service).
2. **Write Dockerfiles** for each microservice.
3. **Write a `docker-compose.yml` file** to:

   * Define all services (containers).
   * Configure ports, volumes, and environment variables.
   * Specify networks and dependencies.
4. **Run with one command:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### 🧠 **Important Concepts**

| Term                      | Meaning                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service**               | A microservice (e.g., web, db) defined in Compose.                              |
| **Container**             | The running instance of a service.                                              |
| **Network**               | Docker Compose can create custom networks for communication between containers. |
| **Volume**                | For persistent storage, shared between host and container.                      |
| **Environment Variables** | Used to configure the service at runtime.                                       |

### 🏗️ **Example `docker-compose.yml` File**

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    networks:
      - app-network

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - app-network

volumes:
  db-data:

networks:
  app-network:
```

### 📚 **History**

* Docker Compose was originally created by a company called **Fig**.
* Docker acquired Fig and rebranded the tool as **Docker Compose**.
* It’s written in Python and designed to simplify complex containerized apps.

### ⚠️ **Trainer’s Advice**

> *Focus deeply on learning Kubernetes first if your goal is container orchestration. Docker Compose is great, but Kubernetes is the industry standard.*
> Don’t confuse Docker services (microservices) with Kubernetes Services (network abstraction). Learn one thoroughly to avoid conceptual clashes.

Certainly! Below is a structured summary of the Docker Compose lab session you described, organized into sections for clarity.

# Docker Compose Lab Overview

## Objective
To create a directory structure for a Python application using Docker Compose, which will automate the deployment of a multi-container application consisting of a web service and a database service.

## Directory Structure
1. **Project Directory**: `project`
   - **App Directory**: `app`
     - `app.py` (Main application code)
     - `requirements.txt` (Dependencies)
   - `docker-compose.yml` (Docker Compose configuration)

## Steps to Create the Directory Structure
1. **Create the Project Directory**:
   - Use a single command to create the necessary directories and files:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p project/app && touch project/app/app.py project/app/requirements.txt project/docker-compose.yml
     ```

2. **Verify Directory Structure**:
   - Navigate to the project directory and check the structure:
     ```bash
     cd project
     tree
     ```

## Writing Application Code
1. **Edit `app.py`**:
   - Use a text editor to write a simple Flask application:
     ```python
     from flask import Flask
     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/')
     def hello():
         return "Hello from Docker Compose!"

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
     ```

2. **Edit `requirements.txt`**:
   - Add Flask as a dependency:
     ```
     Flask
     ```

## Creating the Docker Compose File
1. **Edit `docker-compose.yml`**:
   - Define the services (web and database) in the Docker Compose file:
     ```yaml
     version: '3.8'
     services:
       web:
         build: ./app
         ports:
           - "5000:5000"
         depends_on:
           - db
       db:
         image: postgres:latest
         environment:
           POSTGRES_USER: user
           POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
           POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
         volumes:
           - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

     volumes:
       db_data:
     ```

## Creating the Dockerfile
1. **Create a Dockerfile in the `app` directory**:
   - Define the Dockerfile to build the web service:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM python:3.9-slim
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY requirements.txt .
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
     COPY . .
     CMD ["python", "app.py"]
     ```

## Running the Application
1. **Install Docker Compose** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker-compose
   ```

2. **Start the Application**:
   - Navigate to the project directory and run:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<your-ip>:5000` to see the application running.

## Summary
- Docker Compose simplifies the management of multi-container applications by allowing you to define services, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file.
- The session covered creating a basic Flask application, defining its dependencies, and using Docker Compose to automate the deployment process.

## Additional Notes
- For more complex applications, consider using different Docker Compose files for different environments or versions.
- Always secure sensitive information (like database passwords) using Docker secrets or environment variables.
