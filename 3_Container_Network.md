Here's the breakdown of **Docker Container Networking**, including creating custom networks, communication between containers, and inspecting Docker's network configurations. 

# Docker Container Networking

Understanding how Docker networking works is crucial for managing and troubleshooting (= fixing problems or solving issues with) containerized applications. Here’s an overview of Docker's default network configuration and how to create custom networks for containers.

## Default Network Interface for Containers

Docker creates a virtual network interface for each container to ensure they can communicate with each other and the host machine. This interface is called **VETH** (Virtual Ethernet) and is attached to the **docker0** bridge network.

> ### Network Interface Card (NIC)
> Each machine, whether it’s your laptop or an EC2 instance, has a **Network Interface Card (NIC)** that enables it to connect to external networks. For example:
> - In EC2, the main NIC might be named **ens5 or enX0**.
> - After Docker is installed, a new virtual network interface called **docker0** is created for container networking.

### Inspecting Network Interfaces:
You can inspect network interfaces on your machine using the following command:
```bash
ip a
```
or 
```
ip addr show
```
- When Docker is installed, you'll see the **docker0** interface (used for container communication).
- Each running container gets a **VETH** interface connected to **docker0**.

## Docker Installation and Network Setup

### 1. Installing Docker:
Before Docker is installed, your EC2 instance only has the **ens5** NIC and the **loopback address**.

After Docker installation:
- A new virtual bridge network interface **docker0** is created. (docker0 is network driver)
  
To install Docker:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

### 2. Network Interfaces and Docker0:
When Docker is installed, it creates a virtual **docker0** bridge network. This bridge allows containers to connect to each other and the outside world. The host machine retains its **ens5** NIC for general network connectivity.

- In order to list all Docker networks on your system use the following command:
```
docker network ls
```
You’ll see a table like this:

| NETWORK ID | NAME       | DRIVER | SCOPE |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ | ----- |
| 123abc     | bridge     | bridge | local |
| 456def     | host       | host   | local |
| 789ghi     | none       | null   | local |
| ...        | my\_custom | bridge | local |


### 3. Inspecting Docker Networks:
To inspect the default Docker bridge network, use the following command:
```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```
This will show details about the **docker0** network, including the IP range (e.g., 172.17.0.0/16) and other configuration details.

May show something like:

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "bridge",
    "Id": "a1b2c3...",
    "Driver": "bridge",
    "IPAM": {
      "Config": [
        {
          "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
          "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
        }
      ]
    },
    "Containers": {
      "abc123...": {
        "Name": "my-container",
        "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.2/16"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### 4. Creating a Docker Container:
To create a container, use the following command:
```bash
docker run -d --name container1 alpine
```
This starts a container in the background using the **alpine** image. The container will be connected to the default **docker0** network, and it will receive a **VETH** network interface connected to the **docker0** bridge.

### 5. Accessing the Container:
You can attach to the container using:
```bash
docker attach container1
```
Once inside, run:
```bash
ip a
```
This will show the container's IP address, which could look like `172.17.0.2`.

### 6. Testing Connectivity:
From inside the container, you can test internet connectivity using:
```bash
ping facebook.com
```

#### Traffic Flow:
The traffic from the container flows through multiple network interfaces:
1. **Container → VETH (virtual interface)**.
2. **VETH → Docker network (docker0)**.
3. **Docker network → Main NIC of the host machine**.
4. **Host NIC → Internet → Facebook server**.
5. **Facebook server → Back to the container**.

The traffic routes through **docker0** before it reaches the internet and returns.

### 7. Understanding Docker Networking Flow:
Docker creates a network bridge (`docker0`) on the host machine. Containers connected to this bridge network can communicate with each other and the outside world. Traffic to and from containers is routed through the bridge and the host's network interface.

## Running Containers and Communication Between Them

### 1. Running Containers:
You created two containers, `container1` and `container2`, connected to the default **docker0** network. These containers have their own IP addresses:
- `container1`: IP `172.17.0.2`
- `container2`: IP `172.17.0.3`

### 2. Communication Between Containers:
Since both containers are on the same network (docker0), they can communicate with each other. You can ping `container2` from `container1`, and vice versa:
```bash
ping 172.17.0.3
```

### 3. Network Explanation:
- **docker0** is the default bridge network that allows containers to communicate with each other and the outside world.
- If you ping from a container to the internet, traffic flows through **docker0** to the host machine and out to the internet.

### 4. Creating a Custom Network:
Docker allows you to create custom networks with specific configurations. To create a custom bridge network, use:
```bash
docker network create --driver bridge my-net
```
This command creates a network named `my-net` with a custom IP range (e.g., `172.18.0.0/16`).

### 5. Running Containers on a Custom Network:
Once a custom network is created, you can run containers on it:
```bash
docker run --network my-net --name container100 alpine /bin/sh
```
Containers launched on this network will use IP addresses from the `my-net` network instead of the default `docker0` network.

---

## Docker Commands Summary

1. **Create a Custom Network**:
   - Command: 
   ```bash
   docker network create --driver bridge my-net
   ```

2. **Run a Container on a Custom Network**:
   - Command: 
   ```bash
   docker run --network my-net --name container100 alpine /bin/sh
   ```

3. **Inspect the Default Bridge Network**:
   - Command: 
   ```bash
   docker network inspect bridge
   ```

4. **Inspect a Custom Network**:
   - Command: 
   ```bash
   docker network inspect my-net
   ```

---

## Custom Network vs Default Network

### Custom Networks:
- Custom networks provide more control over the IP addressing and DNS configuration for containers.
- With **user-defined networks** (like `my-net`), containers can communicate using DNS, making it easier to connect services by name (e.g., `container100` can resolve `container200`).
- Docker automatically configures DNS for containers on user-defined networks.

### Default Networks:
- The default **docker0** network does not offer DNS configuration out of the box.
- It’s suitable for simple use cases where DNS resolution and advanced networking features are not necessary.

---

## Final Notes:

1. **Custom Networks**: You use custom networks for better control over IP addresses, DNS, and other networking features.
2. **Kubernetes**: In large-scale setups (e.g., Kubernetes), networking is managed differently to handle scalability and reliability, with features like automatic network configuration and service discovery.

By understanding how Docker networking works, you can better configure, troubleshoot, and scale your containerized applications. Let me know if you need more clarification!

# Quick Recap: Dockerizing a Python Web App and Networking

## 1. Dockerizing a Python Web Application

We started with a **simple Python web application** and converted it into a Docker container by following these steps:

- **Dockerfile Creation**: 
  We wrote a **Dockerfile** to define the environment needed for the application to run inside a container.
  
- **Creating an Image**:
  From the Dockerfile, we built a **Docker image** using the `docker build` command.
  
- **Launching a Container**:
  Once the image was created, we launched a **Docker container** based on that image.

- **Handling Dependencies**:
  The application had external dependencies, so we included a `requirements.txt` file listing all the required packages.
  We made sure these dependencies were installed in the container by referencing the `requirements.txt` in the Dockerfile.
  
By the end of this, we had a Python web application running inside a Docker container, with all dependencies bundled within the container.

---

## 2. Docker Networking Basics

After covering Dockerizing the app, we also discussed how **networking** works in Docker:

### **Networking Before Docker Installation**:
- Before Docker was installed, the machine only used its **default network interface (NIC)** and the **loopback address** (`localhost`) to communicate with the outside world.

### **Docker’s Networking After Installation**:
- After installing Docker, a new network interface called **docker0** was created. This interface allows containers to communicate with each other and the outside world.
  
- **Docker0 Bridge**: This is the default network driver in Docker. It allows containers to communicate with each other and the host machine, but has limitations when you need more control over networking.

---

## 3. User-Defined Bridge Network

To get better control over networking, we created a **user-defined bridge network**. This setup offers several benefits:

- **DNS Resolution**: In a user-defined network, Docker automatically sets up DNS, so containers can communicate using their names (e.g., `container100`, `container200`) instead of relying on IP addresses.
  
- **Custom Control**: It gives you more flexibility with IP ranges and other network settings compared to the default `docker0` network.

---

## 4. How Network Packets Travel

We also discussed the flow of network packets when containers communicate:

### **Communication Between Containers**:
- If **container100** pings **container200**, the network packet flows through the user-defined bridge network, from container100 to the bridge, and then to container200. The response follows the reverse path.

### **Communication with External Servers**:
- If a container needs to reach an external server (e.g., **Google**), the packet travels like this:
  1. From the container's network interface (veth) to the **docker0** bridge network.
  2. Then to the host machine's **main network interface (NIC)** (like ENS5 on EC2).
  3. Finally, it reaches the external server (e.g., Google).
  4. The response is sent back along the same path.
